For instance, we might want to ensure that the string is well-structured, clear, and concise.\n4. Depending on the specific requirements of the AI API, we might need to include certain keywords or phrases in the `person_details` string. For example, we could start the string with a phrase like \"Generate gift ideas for a person who...\" to guide the AI's generation process.\n5. The function will return the formatted `person_details` string as output.

To do this, we'll need to use the Google Search API.\n2) The Google Search API requires a query as input, and returns an array of search results as output. In our case, the query would be each gift idea, and we would be interested in the first search result's link.\n3) Since the Google Search API only takes a single query as input, we'll need to create a map node to run the API for each gift idea. Each run of the API will produce a single search result, which we'll then extract the link from.\n4) The output of the map node will be an array of search results, one for each gift idea. We'll need to create a custom code node to transform this array into the format required for the output metadata of this step. This involves extracting the link from each search result and pairing it with the corresponding gift idea.\n\nBased on this thinking process, we can create the following workflow DAG graph for the current step:\n\nThis DAG represents a map node that runs the Google Search API for each gift idea, followed by a custom code node that transforms the array of search results into the format required for the output metadata of this step.\n...\n1) The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the outputs of the map node and the task outputs. Specifically, the map node outputs are `['search_results']`, but the task outputs are `['search_result']`.\n2) The task outputs are specified in the `task_outputs` field of the map node, where the keys are the task node outputs and the values are the map node outputs. The error message suggests that the map node does not have all the required outputs of the task node, which is the Google Search API in this case.\n3) To fix the error, we need to ensure that the map node has all the required outputs of the task node. This can be done by adjusting the `task_outputs` field of the map node.\n4) The corrected `task_outputs` field should be `{'results': 'search_results'}`. This indicates that the `search_results` output of the map node corresponds to the `results` output of the task node.\n\nThe corrected workflow DAG would be:"
